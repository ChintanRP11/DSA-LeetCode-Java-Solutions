Sliding window is the coding design pattern to solve specific problems in linear time.

Window moves over the data to find specific data or preform operations on that array of data, substring and etc.

Window size varies based on problem definition. 

For some problems, window size is fixed throughout the solution while some problems can be solved by increasing and decreasing window size according to problem definition.

There are many different data structure used in order to store temporary data during the window sliding.
